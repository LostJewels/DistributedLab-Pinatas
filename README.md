# DistributedLab-Pinatas
A tiny program for a DistributedLab challenge. Doesn't have protection against incorrect inputs, 
deliberately breaks if you input a wrong amount of numbers in the second prompt but it DOES work if you follow the instructions.

The program will ask you to enter the number of pinatas first. Input an integer greater than zero and press Enter to confirm.
This will be used as the number of pinatas.
After that punch in the amount of numbers that you have put in first and press Enter again.
Finally, the program will print out the amount of candies you could get after smashing all the pinatas.

Took me half an hour AT MOST and even then most of it was spent spacing out and looking into nowhere.
